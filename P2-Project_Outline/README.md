# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
  As humans, we are innately creative. So often, however, the yearning to make something new is tamped down by the fear of getting stuck, or even worse, getting started. The process can be jumpstarted, and creative blocks can be circumnavigated by introducing just a little outside inspiration.
  To encourage jumping in- a concept for the project must be declared to get started. However, this is fully editable and can change as the idea changes. Random generation of numbers, colors, words, and phrases encourage lateral thinking. The user can create a collection of these pieces of inspiration to start shaping their idea for a project and edit and change the collection as their project evolves. Additional notes fields can be added to a project to prompt actions from included templates, or as an empty field to take your own notes.
